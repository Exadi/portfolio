Originally a portfolio site. Now a CMS with some defaults oriented toward creating a portfolio site.

What I learned about deploying to Cyclic:

- only bundle the backend and built frontend.
- I need to figure out a way to set up future projects that makes this easier.

TODOs to get this fully working on Cyclic:

- move the images to S3 bucket
- change new uploads to go to S3 bucket
